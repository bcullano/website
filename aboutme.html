									<h2>Who is Bryan Cullano?</h2>
								</header>
								<p class="show-on-scroll">I am a 21 year old Mechanical Engineering student entering his fourth year at the New Jersey Insitute of Technology. I live in Bridgewater, New Jersey and am glad to go to school close to home so that I still be with my family.</p>

									<h2>Engineering</h2>
								</header>

								<p class="show-on-scroll">As a kid, I knew I wanted to go into STEM but for most of my life, I wasn't sure what I wanted to study. Towards the end of my high school career, I decided to go into engineering because I wanted to use my skills in math and science to create and solve. I declared a mechanical engineering at the end of my first year in college and ever since, I have been happy with my decision. There is a wide variety of topics within the field, each one offering something interesting to me. As I move up in my curriculum, it is awesome to see how everything I've learned comes together or builds on top of something I learned in a previous class.</p>

								<p class="show-on-scroll">The problem with the variety mechanical engineering offers is that I don't have a specific field that I want to work for. I feel that I would be happy working in several fields. However, that does not stop me from doing my best with any task that I am given.</p>

								<hr class="show-on-scroll"/>

								<header class="show-on-scroll">
									<h2>Interests</h2>
								</header>

								<p class="show-on-scroll">My two main interests/hobbies are music and gaming. Like any other nerdy kid, I grew up interested in video games and the versatility that they offer. They can be simple and goofy, they can be complex and tell timeless stories, or they can even have a mix of both.</p>
								<p class="show-on-scroll">Music has been a big part of my life for over a decade. As a kid I never had music preferences and just listened to whatever was on. I started getting into music when I picked up the violin when I was 10 years old. I was instantly hooked and after watching many YouTube videos to try and improve outside of school, I eventually joined the advanced orchestra at school and started taking private lessons until the end of my senior year in high school. Over the years I picked up some other instruments as well. I play a little bit of guitar every now and then, and I started teaching myself piano during my second year in college.
								Even though I mainly practice classical music and video game/movie soundtracks, my music taste lies on the other end of the spectrum in metal. Everyone is surprised when the quiet kid says he listens to death metal! I am open to all types of music and even if I do not personally enjoy all of them, I can appreciate all genres.</p>
